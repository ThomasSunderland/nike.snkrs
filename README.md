# Thomas Sunderland - Nike Coding Assessment

## Overview
Hello, my name is Thomas Sunderland and I am pleased to present you with this repository which is the 
output of my Nike Coding Assessment.

I spent about one week on this task as time permitted between my other obligations. While tackling this, 
I tried to utilize the latest standard libraries available to Android developers at this time (2021 MAY) 
such as the Jetpack libraries including Lifecycle, Navigation, Room, and ViewModel. 

I also wrote this application 100% in Kotlin and it leverages Kotlin Coroutines and asynchronous data streams via Flow to demonstrate 
that I am capable of delivering a native app in the language now recognized as the standard for developing new Android apps.

Please find a screen capture of my resume (from this app's About screen) below. Thanks!
